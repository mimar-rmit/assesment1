<h1> interest in IT :</h1>
<p> my interest in IT started when i was in the first year universirty ,studyiyg science. My friend picked me to start a job in a shop that repairs computers "changing rams ,hard disks,CD rooms and even motherboards in addtion to formatting and installing windows software" .meanwhile i became addicted to every field related to the computer and technology,where you always have something new to know ,follow and learn that is not boring .
when i decided to study IT , i looked first for an online university since i am working full time and there is no enough time to attend class. Hopefully, this course will be done smoothly and enjoy every subject  "web developement ,networking ,IT applications etc..".</p>
